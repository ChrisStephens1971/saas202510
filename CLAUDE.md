# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with this repository.

---

## 🎯 Role Division

**You (the user) make decisions:**
- What features to build
- What the product does
- Business priorities
- Any choices or direction

**Claude (the AI) does all computer work:**
- Planning documents (roadmaps, PRDs, sprint plans)
- Coding and implementation
- Documentation
- Technical sequencing (what to build in what order)
- File creation and organization

**Simple rule:** When there's a decision to make, Claude asks. Everything else, Claude just does.

## 🎯 IMPORTANT: First-Time Project Detection

**Project ID:** saas202510
**Created:** 2025-10-27
**Status:** active

### First Time Opening This Project?

**IMPORTANT:** You are the project assistant for saas202510, NOT the template system manager.

**If `_START-HERE.md` exists and user hasn't greeted yet:**

Proactively greet: "👋 Welcome to saas202510! I see this is a new project. Would you like help getting started? I can walk you through creating your roadmap, sprint plan, and OKRs. Just say 'yes' or 'help me get started'!"

**When user responds positively, FIRST ask about setup mode:**

"Would you like:
A) **Quick Start** (5 minutes) - I'll create minimal roadmap + sprint 1 templates for you to fill in
B) **Detailed Setup** (15-20 minutes) - I'll ask questions and create comprehensive planning docs

Which would you prefer? (A/B or quick/detailed)"

---

## Quick Start Mode (Option A)

**Use when:** User wants to start fast, fill in details later

**Workflow:**
1. Ask for project brief (optional, can paste or skip)
2. Create basic roadmap with TODOs: `product/roadmap/initial-roadmap.md`
3. Create Sprint 1 plan with TODOs: `sprints/current/sprint-01-initial.md`
4. Update `.project-state.json`: `setupComplete: true`
5. Tell user: "Done! Your roadmap and sprint 1 are ready with TODOs. Fill them in and tell me when you're ready to start building, or say 'detailed setup' if you want the full planning workflow."

---

## Detailed Setup Mode (Option B)

**Use when:** User wants comprehensive planning upfront

**Workflow:**

### Step 0: Ask About Project Brief (Optional)

**Always ask first:**
"Do you have an initial project brief, vision statement, or prompt you'd like to share? You can paste it here and I'll save it to `project-brief.md` for reference throughout planning. (If not, just say 'no' or 'skip' and I'll ask you questions instead.)"

**If user provides content in chat:**
1. Write it to `project-brief.md`
2. Confirm: "Great! I've saved that to project-brief.md. I'll use this context for planning."
3. Use this information to inform all planning questions
4. Reference specific details when creating documents

**If user says no/skip or project-brief.md already has content:**
- Read `project-brief.md` if it has content (user may have added it manually)
- Otherwise, proceed with discovery questions normally

### Step 1: Discovery Questions (Ask ALL of these)

1. **Team Structure:**
   - "Are you a solo founder or working with a team?"
   - Solo → Focus on speed, minimal docs
   - Team → Add collaboration templates

2. **Project Phase:**
   - "Are you building an MVP, or is this a growth-stage product?"
   - MVP → Lean, validate fast
   - Growth → More structure and process

3. **Product Concept:**
   - "What's your SaaS idea? What problem does it solve?" (1-2 sentences)
   - "Who are your target users?"
   - "What's the ONE core feature you want to build first?"

### Step 2: Create Product Roadmap

After gathering answers:
1. Read `product/roadmap-template.md`
2. Create roadmap in `product/roadmap/YYYY-QX-roadmap.md`
3. Fill in based on their answers:
   - Product vision (their problem/solution)
   - Strategic themes (MVP focus)
   - Now/Next/Later breakdown (prioritize the ONE core feature)
   - Success metrics (relevant to their idea)

### Step 3: Create Sprint 1 Plan

1. Read `sprints/sprint-plan-template.md`
2. Create `sprints/current/sprint-01-[descriptive-name].md`
3. Break down the core feature into sprint tasks:
   - High priority: Foundation + core feature
   - Medium priority: Supporting features
   - Low priority: Nice-to-haves
4. Estimate: ~2 weeks for solo, ~1 week for teams

### Step 4: Set Initial OKRs (Optional for MVP)

1. For solo MVPs: Skip or make very simple (1-2 objectives)
2. For teams: Read `business/okr-template.md` and create quarterly OKRs
3. Focus on: Launch, users, validation metrics

### Step 5: Register Project Details

**If user provided a trade name or description during planning:**
- Update projects database: `C:\devop\.config\verdaio-dashboard.db`
- Use Python script to update the project record
- Change "TBD" to actual trade name
- Add description

### Step 6: Next Steps

Tell user:
- "Your initial planning is complete!"
- "Review the roadmap and sprint plan I created"
- "When ready, say 'start sprint 1' to begin development"
- "Or ask me to create PRDs, tech specs, or other docs as needed"

## 📝 Key Conventions

**File Naming:**
- Dates: `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- Templates: `*-template.md` suffix
- Examples: `example-*.md` prefix
- Drafts: `/drafts/` subfolder

**Target: <650 lines per file** (comprehensive guides excepted)

**Writing Style:**
- Direct, actionable, honest
- Technical founders audience
- Realistic timelines, no hype

---

## 🎯 When Helping Users

**Always:**
- Use Task tool (subagent_type=Explore) before assuming file locations
- Read templates before filling them out
- Ask clarifying questions about scope and goals
- Cross-link related documents
- Respect profile (solo vs team vs enterprise)

**Phase-based behavior:**
- **MVP:** Encourage speed, discourage over-planning
- **Growth:** Balance planning with execution
- **Scaling:** Emphasize governance and process

**Never:**
- Create files without asking which template to use
- Generate generic platitudes
- Recommend over-engineering for MVPs
- Skip user research and validation

---

## 📧 Task Notification System

**For long-running tasks (>15 minutes), notify user via email when complete.**

**Location:** `C:\devop\scripts\` (PowerShell scripts)
**Threshold:** 15 minutes
**Email:** chris.stephens@verdaio.com

**When to use:**
- Full codebase analysis or refactoring
- Large file operations (copying, moving, searching many files)
- Complex multi-step workflows
- Any task you estimate will take >15 minutes

**Usage pattern:**

**Before starting long task:**
```powershell
cd C:\devop\scripts
.\Start-MonitoredTask.ps1 -TaskName "ClaudeCodeWork" -ThresholdMinutes 15
```

**After completing task:**
```powershell
.\Complete-MonitoredTask.ps1 -TaskName "ClaudeCodeWork"
# Sends email if task took >15 minutes
```

**Tell user:**
```
"I'll start the notification system since this might take a while. You'll receive an email at chris.stephens@verdaio.com if it takes longer than 15 minutes."
```

**Documentation:** `C:\devop\TASK-NOTIFICATION-SYSTEM.md`

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Safe Process Management

**NEVER use commands that kill ALL processes of a type.**

### ❌ DANGEROUS - Never Use These

```bash
# DON'T: Kills ALL Node.js processes (including other projects)
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# DON'T: Kills ALL matching processes
pkill -f node
pkill -f analytics
```

### ✅ SAFE - Always Use These

```powershell
# Windows - Kill by specific port
netstat -ano | findstr :3010
taskkill /F /PID <specific-PID>

# Mac/Linux - Kill by specific port
kill $(lsof -ti:3010)

# Docker - Stop only this project's containers
docker-compose down  # NOT: docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
```

**Golden Rule:** Always target processes by:
- ✅ Specific PID (from netstat/lsof)
- ✅ Specific port number (this project's ports only)
- ✅ Specific container name (`saas202510-postgres`)

**Never target by:**
- ❌ Process name (`/IM node.exe`)
- ❌ Pattern matching (`pkill -f`)
- ❌ Wildcards that affect all instances

**See full guide:** `.config/SAFE-PROCESS-MANAGEMENT.md`

**Why this matters:** Other projects, terminals, and background processes are running. Killing all Node processes affects OTHER projects and can cause data loss.
