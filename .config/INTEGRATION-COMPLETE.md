### 2. ✅ Updated Virtual Agent Workflows

**Updated 3 key virtual agents to show WSHobson delegation:**

#### Sprint Planner Agent 🏃
**Added Step 6:**
```markdown
6. Optional: Kick off feature implementation (If WSHobson plugins installed)
   - For each story: Offer to run /full-stack-orchestration:full-stack-feature "[story]"
   - Automatically builds database → backend → frontend → tests → deploy
   - Updates sprint tracking as features complete
```

#### System Architect Agent 🏗️
**Added Step 5:**
```markdown
5. Optional: Delegate detailed implementation to WSHobson (If plugins installed)
   - For backend architecture: Use backend-development::backend-architect
   - For database design: Use database-design::database-architect
   - For cloud infrastructure: Use cloud-infrastructure::cloud-architect
   - For API design: Use backend-development::graphql-architect (if GraphQL)
   - For full-stack features: Use full-stack-orchestration command
```

#### QA Testing Agent 🧪
**Added Step 6:**
```markdown
6. Optional: Delegate test implementation to WSHobson (If plugins installed)
   - For automated test generation: Use unit-testing::test-generator
   - For security testing: Use security-scanning::security-auditor
   - For performance testing: Use performance-testing-review::performance-engineer
   - For E2E testing: Use Claude Skill webapp-testing
```

## 📊 Integration Coverage

### What's Now in Your Template

**Three-Tier System:**
- **Tier 1:** 9 Virtual Agents (for planning & project management)

## 🚀 How It Works

### Example: Complete Feature Development

```
User: "plan sprint and build user authentication feature"

━━━ TIER 1: Planning (Virtual Agents) ━━━
→ Sprint Planner Agent
  ✓ Creates sprint plan
  ✓ Adds user authentication story

→ PRD Assistant Agent
  ✓ Creates authentication PRD

→ System Architect Agent
  ✓ High-level architecture
  ✓ Creates ADR for OAuth2 decision

━━━ TIER 3: Implementation (WSHobson) ━━━
→ /full-stack-orchestration:full-stack-feature "user authentication"
  ✓ database-architect → User schema
  ✓ backend-architect → Auth API design
  ✓ python-pro → FastAPI endpoints
  ✓ frontend-developer → Login UI
  ✓ test-generator → Unit tests
  ✓ security-auditor → Security audit
  ✓ deployment-engineer → Deploy to staging

━━━ TIER 1: Documentation (Virtual Agents) ━━━
→ Multi-Doc Generator
  ✓ API documentation
  ✓ User guide

→ QA Testing Agent
  ✓ Test report
```

**Result:** Complete feature from planning → implementation → documentation in one workflow!
