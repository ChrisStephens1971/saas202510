# Executive Summary
## Multi-Tenant HOA Accounting System

**Company:** [Your Company Name]
**Project:** saas202509
**Date:** October 2025
**Confidential**

---

## The Opportunity

**We're building the first multi-tenant fund accounting platform designed specifically for Homeowners Associations (HOAs)** that eliminates $70K+ in annual accounting costs while ensuring zero tolerance for financial errors.

---

## The Problem

370,000 HOAs in the United States struggle with fragmented, error-prone accounting systems:

- **90% use spreadsheets** or generic accounting software not designed for fund accounting
- **Manual bank reconciliation** takes 20-40 hours/month per property
- **Delinquency tracking** is reactive, costing HOAs $50K-$200K annually in lost revenue
- **Audit preparation** requires 60-120 hours of manual ledger reconstruction
- **Zero tolerance for errors** - financial mistakes can result in board liability and legal issues

**Current solutions** (AppFolio, Buildium) serve property managers, NOT HOAs. They lack:
- Proper fund accounting (Operating, Reserve, Special Assessment funds)
- Immutable audit trails for point-in-time reconstruction
- Automated bank reconciliation via Plaid integration
- Delinquency workflow automation with certified notice tracking

---

## Our Solution

**A multi-tenant SaaS platform with:**

### 1. Fund Accounting (Core Differentiator)
- Separate accounting for Operating, Reserve, and Special Assessment funds
- Double-entry bookkeeping with zero error tolerance (NUMERIC(15,2) for all amounts)
- Event-sourced, immutable ledger for audit compliance

### 2. Bank Reconciliation (90%+ Auto-Match)
- Plaid integration for real-time bank feeds
- AI-powered transaction matching
- Reduces 20-40 hours/month to 2-4 hours

### 3. AR/Collections Automation
- Automated delinquency detection and escalation
- Certified notice tracking (legal compliance)
- Lien filing preparation and documentation

### 4. Audit Trail & Compliance
- Immutable ledger (INSERT only, never UPDATE/DELETE)
- Point-in-time reconstruction for any date
- Automated financial statement generation (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow)

## Risk Factors

**Market Risk:**
- HOA boards can be slow to adopt new technology (mitigation: focus on cost savings)
- Sales cycles can be long (60-90 days) due to board approval processes

**Competitive Risk:**
- AppFolio or Buildium could add fund accounting (mitigation: 2-3 year head start, innovator's dilemma)
- IronLedger/Palomma could pivot to HOAs (mitigation: vertical specialization, deeper feature set)

**Execution Risk:**
- Solo founder (mitigation: hiring CTO as first use of funds)
- Complex domain (fund accounting, audit compliance) - requires specialized knowledge

**Regulatory Risk:**
- Financial software compliance (mitigation: audit-grade architecture, CPA advisors)

---

## Exit Strategy

**Target Acquirers:**
1. **AppFolio** ($1.5B market cap) - Add HOA fund accounting to portfolio
2. **Buildium/RealPage** - Expand property management suite
3. **Yardi** - Largest property management software company
4. **Intuit** (QuickBooks) - Enter vertical accounting market
5. **Private Equity** - Roll-up play (consolidate HOA software)

**Comparable Exits:**
- **Buildium** acquired by RealPage for $580M (2019)
- **AppFolio** IPO at $2.1B valuation (2015)
- **Yardi** (private) estimated $3B+ valuation

**Target Timeline:** 5-7 years to exit at $50M-$150M valuation (10-20x ARR at $5M-$10M)
