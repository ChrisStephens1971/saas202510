### Year 2 (2027) - Scale to 100 Customers

| Quarter | New Customers | Churned | Total Customers | Avg MRR/Customer | MRR | Quarterly Revenue | ARR |
|---------|---------------|---------|-----------------|------------------|-----|-------------------|-----|
| Q1 | 15 | 0 | 55 | $455 | $25,000 | $75,000 | $300,000 |

- MRR/customer increases from $455 → $500 (moving upmarket to larger HOAs)
- No churn yet (high switching costs, customers still in initial contracts)

---

### Year 3 (2028) - Reach $1.5M ARR

| Quarter | New Customers | Churned | Net New | Total Customers | Avg MRR/Customer | MRR | ARR |
|---------|---------------|---------|---------|-----------------|------------------|-----|-----|

- Acceleration due to partnerships with property management companies
- MRR/customer continues increasing (larger HOAs, better pricing power)
- Still minimal churn (early adopters loyal)

---

### Year 4 (2029) - Scale to $3.2M ARR

| Quarter | New Customers | Churned | Net New | Total Customers | Avg MRR/Customer | MRR | ARR |
|---------|---------------|---------|---------|-----------------|------------------|-----|-----|

- High churn (6%) but offset by strong acquisition (80-85/quarter)
- MRR/customer slightly declines (more small HOAs via self-serve)
- **Profitability achieved** (revenue exceeds burn rate)

## Unit Economics

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

| Year | Sales & Marketing Spend | New Customers | CAC |
|------|-------------------------|---------------|-----|
| 2026 | $120,000 | 40 | $3,000 |
| 2027 | $180,000 | 60 | $3,000 |
| 2028 | $375,000 | 125 | $3,000 |
| 2029 | $600,000 | 225 | $2,667 |
| 2030 | $660,000 | 330 | $2,000 |

**CAC Reduction:** $3,000 (Year 1) → $2,000 (Year 5) due to channel maturity

---

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Average MRR** | $500 | Blended across all tiers |
| **Average Customer Lifespan** | 5 years | High switching costs, sticky product |
| **Total Revenue per Customer** | $30,000 | $500/mo × 60 months |
| **Gross Margin** | 85% | Standard SaaS margin |
| **LTV** | $25,500 | $30,000 × 85% |

---

### LTV/CAC Ratio

| Year | LTV | CAC | LTV/CAC Ratio |
|------|-----|-----|---------------|
| 2026 | $25,500 | $3,000 | 8.5x |
| 2027 | $25,500 | $3,000 | 8.5x |
| 2028 | $25,500 | $3,000 | 8.5x |
| 2029 | $25,500 | $2,667 | 9.6x |
| 2030 | $25,500 | $2,000 | 12.8x |

**Target:** LTV/CAC > 3x (healthy SaaS)
**Actual:** 8.5x-12.8x (excellent unit economics)

---

### CAC Payback Period

| Metric | Calculation | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **CAC** | $3,000 | Cost to acquire one customer |
| **Monthly Gross Margin** | $425 | $500 MRR × 85% margin |
| **CAC Payback Period** | $3,000 / $425 | **7 months** |

**Industry Benchmark:** 12-18 months
**Our Target:** 7-9 months (strong)

## Notes for Excel Transfer

**To recreate this model in Excel/Google Sheets:**

1. Create separate tabs for:
   - Summary Dashboard
   - Revenue Model (monthly)
   - Expense Model (monthly)
   - Unit Economics
   - Scenario Analysis
   - Cap Table
   - Funding Rounds

2. Use formulas for:
   - MRR = Total Customers × Avg MRR/Customer
   - ARR = MRR × 12
   - Churn Rate = Churned Customers / Total Customers
   - LTV = (Avg MRR × Customer Lifespan × 12) × Gross Margin
   - CAC = Sales & Marketing Spend / New Customers
   - CAC Payback = CAC / (Monthly Gross Margin)

3. Add charts for:
   - ARR growth over time
   - Customer acquisition vs. churn
   - Monthly burn rate
   - Unit economics (LTV/CAC, CAC payback)
   - Revenue by customer tier

4. Enable scenario analysis with input variables:
   - Customer growth rate
   - Avg MRR per customer
   - Churn rate
   - Sales & marketing efficiency
