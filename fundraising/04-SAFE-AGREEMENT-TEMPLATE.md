## How a SAFE Works

### Investment Today
1. Investor gives you **$100,000**
2. You give investor a **SAFE note** (not equity yet!)
3. SAFE has two key terms:
   - **Valuation Cap:** $2,000,000
   - **Discount:** 20%

### Conversion at Next Round (Example)

**Scenario: 18 months later, you raise Series A**
- Series A price: $10,000,000 pre-money valuation
- Series A share price: $10.00/share

**Investor's conversion options:**
1. **Use the cap:** $100,000 / $2M cap = **5% of company** (better for investor)
2. **Use the discount:** $100,000 at 20% discount = $100,000 / $8.00/share (not as good)

**Investor chooses:** Option 1 (the cap), gets 5% equity

**Your dilution:**
- Investor got 5% for $100K investment
- If they invested at Series A ($10M), they would only get 1%
- **Investor's benefit:** 5x better deal for taking early risk

---

## Four Types of SAFEs

### 1. Valuation Cap ONLY (Most Common)

**Terms:**
- Valuation cap: $2M
- No discount

**Conversion:**
- Investor converts at the cap OR the next round price, whichever is LOWER

**Use when:** You want simplicity, willing to give cap but not discount

---

### 2. Discount ONLY

**Terms:**
- No valuation cap
- Discount: 20%

**Conversion:**
- Investor converts at 20% discount to next round price

**Use when:** Very early stage, can't estimate valuation yet

---

### 3. Valuation Cap + Discount (Recommended for You)

**Terms:**
- Valuation cap: $2M
- Discount: 20%

**Conversion:**
- Investor uses whichever is BETTER for them (cap or discount)

**Use when:** Investor taking significant risk, you want to reward them

---

### 4. MFN (Most Favored Nation)

**Terms:**
- No cap, no discount
- Investor gets same terms as next SAFE investor

**Conversion:**
- If you sell another SAFE with better terms, this investor gets those terms too

**Use when:** Friends & family, very early, uncertain terms

---

## Recommended SAFE Terms for Your Situation

### For a $10,000 Investment

**Recommended Structure:**
- **Type:** Valuation Cap + Discount
- **Valuation Cap:** $1,500,000
- **Discount:** 20%
- **Pro Rata Rights:** Yes (optional)

**Why these terms:**
- $1.5M cap is fair for pre-revenue (lower than my optimistic $3.5M)
- 20% discount is standard (rewards early risk)
- Pro rata lets investor maintain % (investor-friendly)

**What investor gets:**
- If next round at $5M → Investor converts at $1.5M cap (better)
- If next round at $1M → Investor converts at 20% discount (better)
- Investor always gets best deal available

---

### For a $100K-$500K Round

**Recommended Structure:**
- **Type:** Valuation Cap + Discount
- **Valuation Cap:** $2,000,000
- **Discount:** 20%
- **Pro Rata Rights:** Yes

**Why these terms:**
- $2M cap is reasonable for larger round
- Still rewards early investors significantly
- Standard YC terms

## Common SAFE Questions

### Q: What if I never raise another round?

**A:** The SAFE doesn't convert. Investor doesn't get equity unless there's:
1. Equity financing (priced round)
2. Liquidity event (acquisition)
3. IPO

**Mitigation:** Include dissolution clause (investor gets money back if company shuts down)

---

### Q: What if my next round is at a LOWER valuation than the cap?

**A:** Investor still converts at the lower valuation (SAFE cap doesn't help them in down rounds, but discount does).

**Example:**
- SAFE cap: $2M, discount 20%
- Next round: $1M valuation
- Investor converts at: $800K (1M × 80% discount) - gets 12.5% equity
- If no discount, they'd convert at $1M - get 10% equity

---

### Q: Can I have multiple SAFEs with different terms?

**A:** Yes, but be careful:
- Each investor can have different cap/discount
- Later SAFEs should have SAME or HIGHER caps (don't give better deal to later investors)
- Track all SAFEs on cap table

**Example:**
- First SAFE: $100K at $1.5M cap
- Second SAFE: $200K at $2M cap (fair - higher cap)
- Third SAFE: $50K at $1M cap (BAD - better deal than first investor, unless MFN clause)

---

### Q: What happens to SAFE holders when I raise Series A?

**A:** SAFEs automatically convert to equity at the Series A.

**Sequence:**
1. Series A lead sets price (e.g., $10M pre-money, $1.00/share)
2. SAFEs convert FIRST using their caps/discounts
3. THEN Series A investors get their shares
4. All shares issued together in one transaction

**Post-Series A cap table:**
- Founders: X%
- SAFE investors: Y% (converted)
- Series A investors: Z%
- Total: 100%

---

## When NOT to Use a SAFE

**Use priced equity round instead if:**
- Investor demands board seat
- Investor wants immediate equity (not future conversion)
- Investment >$1M (institutional investors may want priced round)
- You want specific investor protections (liquidation preferences, anti-dilution)
- You're raising your Series A (use priced equity)

**SAFEs are best for:**
- Friends & family
- Angels
- Pre-seed / seed rounds <$500K
- When you want to close fast and cheap
