## üí∞ Valuation Guidance

### Your Recommended Valuation

**Current Stage:** Pre-revenue, MVP development

**Realistic Valuations:**
- **Conservative:** $1M - $1.5M pre-money
- **Moderate:** $1.5M - $2.5M pre-money
- **Aggressive:** $2.5M - $3.5M pre-money

**Recommendation:** Start with **$2M valuation cap** on SAFE with 20% discount

**Why?**
- Fair for pre-revenue stage
- Below average pre-seed ($5.7M per 2025 data)
- Leaves room for Series A at higher valuation
- Attractive terms for early-risk investors

---

### For a $10K Investment at $2M Cap

| Scenario | Equity at Conversion | Notes |
|----------|---------------------|-------|
| **SAFE Cap** | ~0.5% | If next round at $5M+ |
| **Direct Equity** | 0.5% | If priced round now |

**Recommendation:** Use SAFE with $2M cap + 20% discount

---

### For a $100K Investment at $2M Cap

| Scenario | Equity at Conversion | Notes |
|----------|---------------------|-------|
| **SAFE Cap** | ~5% | If next round at $5M+ |
| **Direct Equity** | ~4.8% | If priced round now |

**Dilution Impact:** 5% is reasonable for $100K pre-revenue

## üìß Sample Investor Email

**Subject:** Introduction - Multi-Tenant HOA Accounting Platform

**Body:**

```
Hi [Investor Name],

[Mutual connection] suggested I reach out. I'm building a multi-tenant fund accounting platform for HOAs that eliminates $70K+ in annual costs through AI-powered bank reconciliation.

Quick context:
‚Ä¢ Market: 370K HOAs in the US, 90% use spreadsheets
‚Ä¢ Problem: Manual bank reconciliation takes 20-40 hours/month
‚Ä¢ Solution: SaaS platform with fund accounting, AI matching, audit trails
‚Ä¢ Traction: 50+ customer interviews, 90% cited this as #1 pain point
‚Ä¢ Ask: Raising $100K-$500K on a SAFE ($2M cap, 20% discount)

Attached is a 1-page executive summary. Happy to send the full deck and schedule a call if this is interesting to you.

Would you have 15 minutes this week to chat?

Best,
[Your Name]
[Your Title]
[Email]
[Phone]
[LinkedIn]
```

**Attachments:**

## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Sending Pitch Deck in First Email

**Wrong:** "Here's my 20-slide pitch deck attached"
**Right:** "Here's a 1-page summary. Happy to send full deck if interested"

**Why?** Investors get 100+ decks/week. They won't read yours unless you give them a reason.

---

### Mistake 2: Not Practicing Your Pitch

**Wrong:** Winging it, reading slides verbatim
**Right:** Practice 10+ times, tell a story, engage audience

**Why?** First impression matters. Confidence comes from preparation.

---

### Mistake 3: Overvaluing Your Company

**Wrong:** "$10M valuation for pre-revenue solo founder"
**Right:** "$2M cap SAFE, leaves room for Series A upside"

**Why?** Overvaluing scares away investors. Better to raise at fair terms quickly.

---

### Mistake 4: Not Being Ready for Due Diligence

**Wrong:** "Uh, I don't have that document. Let me get back to you in 2 weeks."
**Right:** "Yes, here's the link to our data room. All documents are there."

**Why?** Slow response = loss of momentum. Investors move on.

---

### Mistake 5: Talking Too Much About Product, Not Enough About Market

**Wrong:** "Let me show you every feature in detail for 30 minutes"
**Right:** "The market is $1.85B. Here's the pain point. Here's our solution (2 min demo)."

**Why?** Investors care about market size > product features.
