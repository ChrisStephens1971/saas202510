# Slide 2: The Problem

## HOAs Struggle with Broken Accounting

**370,000 HOAs in the US face:**

### 90% Use Spreadsheets
Generic accounting software not designed for fund accounting

### 20-40 Hours/Month on Bank Reconciliation
Manual, error-prone process

### $50K-$200K Lost Revenue Annually
Reactive delinquency tracking, no automation

### 60-120 Hours for Audit Prep
Manual ledger reconstruction, compliance nightmares

**Result:** Board liability, legal issues, expensive outsourced CPAs

---

# Slide 3: Real Customer Pain Points

## What HOA Treasurers Tell Us

> "I spend 30 hours a month matching bank transactions in Excel. One mistake and the board could be personally liable."
**— HOA Treasurer, 150-unit community**

> "We pay our CPA $85K/year to do what should be automated. We need fund accounting, not property management software."
**— HOA President, 300-unit community**

> "Tracking delinquencies manually is a nightmare. We lose $120K annually because we don't catch late payments fast enough."
**— HOA Board Member, 200-unit community**

**50+ interviews confirmed:** Bank reconciliation is the #1 pain point

---

# Appendix E: Risk Mitigation

## How We Address Key Risks

### Risk 1: Slow adoption by HOA boards
**Mitigation:**
- Focus on cost savings ($60K-$110K/year) - boards respond to money
- Offer free migration assistance (white-glove onboarding)
- Target "champion" board members (treasurers) who feel the pain most

### Risk 2: AppFolio/Buildium adds fund accounting
**Mitigation:**
- 2-3 year head start (takes years to rebuild architecture)
- Innovator's dilemma (won't cannibalize existing product)
- Vertical specialization (we'll always be better for HOAs)

### Risk 3: Solo founder risk
**Mitigation:**
- First use of funds: hire CTO (25% equity reserved)
- Advisory board with operational experience
- Document everything to reduce bus factor

### Risk 4: Complex domain (fund accounting)
**Mitigation:**
- Advisor: CPA with 15+ years HOA accounting experience
- Early customer pilots to validate product
- Iterative development with tight feedback loops
