## Due Diligence FAQ

### Q: What if I don't have something on this checklist?

**A:** Be honest. Say "We haven't done that yet, but here's our plan..."

**Example:**
- Investor: "Do you have a trademark?"
- You: "Not yet. We'll file after we close this round and finalize our name. Preliminary search shows no conflicts."

**Investors expect gaps at pre-seed stage.** Honesty > pretending you have something.

---

### Q: How much should I share before they commit?

**A:** Depends on the investor:

**Before term sheet:**
- Share pitch deck
- Share financials (high-level)
- Product demo

**After term sheet (signed):**
- Share everything (full due diligence)

**Never share before NDA (if sensitive):**
- Customer lists
- Detailed financials
- Proprietary technology details

---

### Q: What if they find something concerning?

**A:** Address it head-on:

1. Acknowledge the issue
2. Explain context
3. Show how you'll fix it
4. Don't hide or minimize

**Example:**
- Issue: Founder doesn't have 83(b) filed
- Response: "You're right, I missed that. I'll file immediately (still within 30 days). My lawyer will handle it this week."

---

### Q: Can due diligence kill a deal?

**A:** Yes, if there are major red flags:
- Founder lied about something material
- Cap table is a mess (conflicting claims)
- Outstanding lawsuit
- Product doesn't work as claimed

**Prevention:** Be honest from the start, keep clean records
