# Sprint 1 - Test Data Foundation

**Sprint Duration:** 2025-11-11 - 2025-11-22 (2 weeks)
**Sprint Goal:** Build foundational test data generators and property-based testing framework to validate core accounting invariants
**Status:** Planning

---

## Sprint Goal

Establish the testing foundation by creating realistic HOA test data generators and implementing property-based testing to validate core accounting rules. By the end of this sprint, we should be able to:

1. Generate realistic HOA scenarios (members, properties, transactions)
2. Run property-based tests that prove `debits = credits` for any transaction
3. Validate fund balances never go negative (unless explicitly allowed)
4. Have a repeatable testing framework for all future sprints

**Why this matters:** Without quality test data and automated invariant checking, we can't confidently test the accounting system (saas202509) as it's being built in parallel.

## Sprint Capacity

**Available Days:** 10 working days (2 weeks)
**Capacity:** 80 hours (full-time solo founder)
**Commitments/Time Off:** None planned
**Buffer:** 20% for unexpected complexity (~16 hours reserved)

**Total High Priority Estimate:** ~38 hours (leaves buffer for complexity)

### Medium Priority (Should Complete)

| Story | Description | Estimate | Assignee | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------------|----------|----------|--------|-------|

| **QA-011** | Document test data generator usage | S (3h) | Solo | üìã Todo | README with examples of how to use generators |
| **QA-012** | Add data type validation (NUMERIC, DATE) | S (4h) | Solo | üìã Todo | Ensure generators use correct data types (no floats for money) |

**Total Medium Priority Estimate:** ~19 hours

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

| Story | Description | Estimate | Assignee | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------------|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| **QA-013** | Create edge case generators (partial payments, overpayments) | M (6h) | Solo | üìã Todo | Can push to Sprint 2 if time runs out |
| **QA-014** | Set up test PostgreSQL database | M (5h) | Solo | üìã Todo | Schema-per-tenant architecture; can defer to Sprint 2 |
| **QA-015** | Add CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions) | S (4h) | Solo | üìã Todo | Run tests automatically on push; nice to have |

**Total Low Priority Estimate:** ~15 hours

## Technical Debt / Maintenance

Items that need attention:

- [ ] Review saas202509 schema changes (check for drift between projects)
- [ ] Set up linting/formatting (black, ruff, mypy) for consistency
- [ ] Create `.gitignore` for Python cache files, test databases

## Technical Notes & Decisions

### Data Type Strategy
- **Money:** NUMERIC(15,2) - **NEVER** float or Decimal with arbitrary precision
- **Dates:** DATE type (not datetime for accounting dates)
- **Amounts:** Always 2 decimal places for USD
- **IDs:** UUID for tenant isolation

### Test Data Design Principles
1. **Realistic distributions:** Most members pay on time, some are late, few are delinquent
2. **Edge cases matter:** Test partial payments, overpayments, refunds, adjustments
3. **Temporal accuracy:** Respect fiscal years, leap years, timezone handling
4. **Compositional:** Generators should compose (Member + Property + Transaction)

### Property-Based Testing Strategy
- Start with simple properties (debits=credits)
- Add complex properties as we learn (point-in-time reconstruction)
- Use Hypothesis shrinking to find minimal failing examples
- Aim for 100+ examples per property test

## Next Sprint Preview (Sprint 2)

Likely focus areas for Sprint 2 (tentative):
- Financial transaction testing harness
- Test database setup (schema-per-tenant PostgreSQL)
- Edge case generators (timezones, retroactive corrections)
- Double-entry bookkeeping validators
