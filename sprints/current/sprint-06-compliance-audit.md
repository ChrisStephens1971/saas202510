# Sprint 6: Compliance & Audit Features

**Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks
**Sprint Goal**: Implement audit trails, compliance verification, and immutable event sourcing
**Priority**: High (Essential for financial compliance and regulatory requirements)

---

## Sprint Overview

Sprint 6 focuses on implementing comprehensive audit trails and compliance features required for HOA financial systems. This includes:

1. **Audit Trail Generation**: Complete history of all financial changes
2. **Immutability Verification**: Ensure ledger entries are never modified or deleted
3. **Compliance Reports**: Generate reports for auditors and regulators
4. **Event Sourcing Patterns**: Implement complete audit log with event replay
5. **Historical Report Generation**: PDF/Excel exports of financial statements at any historical date

**Dependencies**: Sprint 5 (Point-in-Time Reconstruction) - COMPLETE

## Technical Design

### 1. Audit Trail System

**File**: `src/qa_testing/compliance/audit_trail.py`

```python
class AuditEntry(BaseTestModel):
    """Single audit trail entry."""
    audit_id: UUID
    tenant_id: UUID
    event_type: AuditEventType  # TRANSACTION_CREATED, ENTRY_POSTED, etc.
    entity_type: str  # "Transaction", "LedgerEntry", etc.
    entity_id: UUID
    user_id: Optional[UUID]
    timestamp: datetime
    before_state: Optional[dict]  # State before change (if applicable)
    after_state: dict  # State after change
    change_reason: Optional[str]
    ip_address: Optional[str]
    user_agent: Optional[str]

class AuditTrailGenerator:
    """Generate audit trails for all financial operations."""

    @staticmethod
    def create_audit_entry(
        tenant_id: UUID,
        event_type: AuditEventType,
        entity: Any,
        user_id: Optional[UUID] = None,
        before_state: Optional[dict] = None,
        change_reason: Optional[str] = None,
    ) -> AuditEntry:
        """Create audit entry for any financial change."""

    @staticmethod
    def get_audit_trail(
        entity_id: UUID,
        start_date: Optional[date] = None,
        end_date: Optional[date] = None,
    ) -> list[AuditEntry]:
        """Get complete audit trail for entity."""

    @staticmethod
    def get_user_activity(
        user_id: UUID,
        start_date: date,
        end_date: date,
    ) -> list[AuditEntry]:
        """Get all changes made by specific user."""
```

### 2. Immutability Verification

**File**: `src/qa_testing/compliance/immutability_validator.py`

```python
class ImmutabilityValidator:
    """Verify ledger entries follow INSERT-only pattern."""

    @staticmethod
    def verify_no_updates(ledger_entries: list[LedgerEntry]) -> bool:
        """Verify no ledger entries have been updated after creation."""

    @staticmethod
    def verify_no_deletes(
        expected_entry_ids: list[UUID],
        actual_entries: list[LedgerEntry],
    ) -> bool:
        """Verify no ledger entries have been deleted."""

    @staticmethod
    def verify_correction_pattern(
        original_entry: LedgerEntry,
        correction_entries: list[LedgerEntry],
    ) -> bool:
        """Verify corrections follow reversing entry pattern."""

    @staticmethod
    def generate_immutability_report(
        ledger_entries: list[LedgerEntry],
    ) -> ImmutabilityReport:
        """Generate report verifying ledger immutability."""
```

### 3. Compliance Reports

**File**: `src/qa_testing/compliance/report_generator.py`

```python
class ComplianceReportGenerator:
    """Generate compliance reports for auditors."""

    @staticmethod
    def generate_general_ledger(
        tenant_id: UUID,
        start_date: date,
        end_date: date,
        format: ReportFormat = ReportFormat.PDF,
    ) -> bytes:
        """Generate General Ledger report."""

    @staticmethod
    def generate_trial_balance(
        tenant_id: UUID,
        as_of_date: date,
        format: ReportFormat = ReportFormat.PDF,
    ) -> bytes:
        """Generate Trial Balance report."""

    @staticmethod
    def generate_audit_summary(
        tenant_id: UUID,
        audit_period: tuple[date, date],
    ) -> AuditSummaryReport:
        """Generate audit summary for period."""
```

### 4. Event Sourcing

**File**: `src/qa_testing/compliance/event_store.py`

```python
class FinancialEvent(BaseTestModel):
    """Financial event for event sourcing."""
    event_id: UUID
    tenant_id: UUID
    event_type: str  # "DuesPaymentReceived", "VendorPaymentMade", etc.
    aggregate_id: UUID  # ID of entity (Member, Fund, etc.)
    aggregate_type: str
    event_data: dict
    timestamp: datetime
    sequence_number: int
    user_id: Optional[UUID]

class EventStore:
    """Store and replay financial events."""

    @staticmethod
    def append_event(event: FinancialEvent) -> None:
        """Append event to store (immutable)."""

    @staticmethod
    def get_events(
        aggregate_id: UUID,
        from_sequence: int = 0,
    ) -> list[FinancialEvent]:
        """Get all events for aggregate."""

    @staticmethod
    def replay_events(
        aggregate_id: UUID,
        up_to_timestamp: Optional[datetime] = None,
    ) -> Any:
        """Replay events to reconstruct aggregate state."""
```

|------|--------|------------|
| PDF generation performance | High | Use templates, generate async |
| Event store size growth | Medium | Implement archival strategy |
| Audit log storage | Medium | Compression, retention policies |
| Report accuracy | High | Extensive testing against known data |
