## 1. Executive Summary

We're redesigning the user onboarding flow to reduce time-to-value and increase activation rates. The new experience will guide users through key setup steps and help them achieve their first success within 5 minutes.

## 2. Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?

Currently, 60% of new sign-ups never complete the initial setup, and only 25% of users who sign up reach activation (defined as completing their first core action). Users report feeling confused about what to do first and don't understand the value proposition quickly enough.

### Who has this problem?

- **Primary Users:** New free-tier sign-ups who are trying the product for the first time
- **Secondary Users:** Paid customers who need to onboard team members

### Why is this important now?

We're increasing marketing spend and driving more sign-ups. If we can't convert these users, we're wasting acquisition dollars. A 10% improvement in activation could mean 200+ more active users per month.

## 3. Goals and Success Metrics

### Primary Goals

1. Increase activation rate from 25% to 40%
2. Reduce time-to-first-value from 30 minutes to 5 minutes
3. Improve NPS for new users from 35 to 50

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Timeline |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| Activation rate | 25% | 40% | Q1 2025 |
| Time to first action | 30 min | 5 min | Q1 2025 |
| Setup completion | 40% | 70% | Q1 2025 |
| New user NPS | 35 | 50 | Q1 2025 |

## 4. User Stories

**As a** new user signing up for the first time
**I want** clear guidance on what to do next
**So that** I can quickly understand the product value and achieve my goal

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User sees a welcome screen immediately after sign-up
- [ ] Onboarding flow has 3-5 clear steps
- [ ] User can skip onboarding if they prefer
- [ ] User completes at least one core action during onboarding
- [ ] Progress is saved if user exits mid-flow

## 5. Requirements

### Must Have (P0)
- Welcome screen with value proposition
- 3-step guided setup flow
- Ability to skip onboarding
- Progress indicator showing steps completed
- Celebration screen after first success

### Should Have (P1)
- Personalization based on use case selection
- Interactive tutorial overlays
- Sample data for exploration
- Email follow-up for incomplete onboarding

### Nice to Have (P2)
- Video walkthrough option
- Live chat support during onboarding
- Customizable onboarding paths

## 6. User Experience

### User Flow

```
Sign Up → Welcome Screen → Select Use Case →
Step 1: Create First Project →
Step 2: Add First Item →
Step 3: Complete First Action →
Celebration! → Dashboard
```

### Key Interactions

1. **Welcome Screen:** Shows value prop, estimated time (5 min), option to skip
2. **Use Case Selection:** User picks from 3-4 common use cases to personalize experience
3. **Guided Steps:** Each step has clear instructions, visual cues, and a "Next" button
4. **Progress Bar:** Shows "Step 2 of 3" at the top
5. **Celebration:** Confetti animation + message when onboarding complete

## 7. Technical Considerations

### Architecture Overview

- Frontend: New React components for onboarding flow
- Backend: API endpoints to track onboarding progress
- Analytics: Events for each onboarding step

### Dependencies

- Analytics system must be able to track onboarding events
- Email service for follow-up emails

### API/Integration Requirements

- `POST /api/onboarding/progress` - Save user progress
- `GET /api/onboarding/status` - Check if user completed onboarding
- Integration with analytics platform (e.g., Mixpanel, Amplitude)

### Data Requirements

- Store onboarding status per user (step completed, skipped, date)
- Track which use case selected
- Privacy: No PII required beyond what we already collect

## 8. Launch Plan

### Rollout Strategy

- [ ] Internal testing (week 1)
- [ ] Beta to 10% of new sign-ups (week 2)
- [ ] Analyze data, iterate if needed (week 3)
- [ ] Gradual rollout to 50% (week 4)
- [ ] Full release to 100% (week 5)

### Success Criteria for Launch

- No critical bugs reported
- Activation rate increases by at least 5%
- User feedback is positive (>70% satisfaction)

### Marketing/Communication Plan

- Blog post announcing improved onboarding
- Email to existing users: "We've made getting started easier"
- Social media posts highlighting ease of use

## 9. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Users find flow too prescriptive | High | Medium | Make skip button prominent, A/B test |
| Technical bugs during rollout | High | Low | Gradual rollout, thorough testing |
| Doesn't actually improve metrics | High | Medium | Run for 2 weeks, be ready to rollback |

## 10. Timeline and Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Status |

## 11. Open Questions

- [x] Should we show onboarding on mobile or wait for web-only?
  - Answer: Web only for V1, mobile in V2
- [ ] How do we handle users who signed up but never completed onboarding months ago?
- [ ] Should we let users restart onboarding from settings?
