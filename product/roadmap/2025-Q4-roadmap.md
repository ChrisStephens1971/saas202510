# Product Roadmap - Q4 2025 → Q2 2026

**Period:** Q4 2025 → Q2 2026 (7-10 months to MVP)
**Owner:** Solo Founder
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-27
**Status:** Draft

## Vision & Strategy

### Product Vision

Build a comprehensive QA/Testing infrastructure for the Multi-Tenant HOA Accounting System (saas202509) with **zero tolerance for financial errors**. This testing harness ensures every financial transaction, balance calculation, and audit trail operation meets accounting standards through property-based testing, realistic test data generation, and comprehensive integration testing.

**Core Principle:** Financial software cannot "mostly work" - it must be 100% accurate. This infrastructure validates accounting invariants (debits = credits, fund balances never negative, immutable audit trails) before code reaches production.

### Strategic Themes for This Period

1. **Test Data Excellence** - Generate realistic, comprehensive HOA scenarios that mirror production complexity
2. **Accounting Invariant Validation** - Property-based tests that prove financial correctness under all conditions
3. **Integration Testing Infrastructure** - Validate external integrations (Plaid, payment processors) with real-world edge cases
4. **Developer Velocity** - Make testing fast, reliable, and easy so saas202509 development moves confidently

### Future/Backlog (Q2 2026+)
**Focus:** Advanced Testing + Performance

Ideas being considered for post-MVP:
- **Performance Testing:** Load testing for multi-tenant scenarios (1000+ properties)
- **Chaos Engineering:** Simulate database failures, network partitions during transactions
- **Compliance Reporting Tests:** GAAP compliance, year-end close procedures
- **UI Testing:** Frontend tests for financial dashboards (Playwright/Cypress)
- **Mutation Testing:** Validate test suite quality by introducing bugs
- **Security Testing:** Test authorization (tenant isolation), SQL injection prevention

## Detailed Feature Breakdown

### Test Data Generators (Sprint 1)

**Problem:** Need realistic HOA scenarios to test against - members with varying payment histories, properties with different fee structures, complex assessment schedules
**Solution:** Build composable data generators that create valid HOA entities (members, properties, units, transactions) with realistic distributions and edge cases
**Impact:** Enables all other testing - without good test data, tests are meaningless
**Effort:** Medium (2 weeks)
**Dependencies:** None - foundational
**Status:** Not Started
**PRD:** `product/PRDs/test-data-generators-prd.md` (to be created)

**Key Components:**
- Member generator (owners, tenants, board members)
- Property/unit generator (condos, HOAs, different fee structures)
- Transaction generator (dues, assessments, late fees, vendor payments)
- Edge case generator (partial payments, overpayments, credits)

---

### Property-Based Testing Framework (Sprint 1)

**Problem:** Traditional unit tests only test cases you think of - property-based testing proves invariants hold for ALL inputs
**Solution:** Implement Hypothesis (Python) or Fast-Check (TypeScript) to generate thousands of test cases automatically
**Impact:** Catches edge cases humans never think of - critical for financial software
**Effort:** Medium (2 weeks)
**Dependencies:** Test data generators
**Status:** Not Started
**PRD:** `product/PRDs/property-based-testing-prd.md` (to be created)

**Core Properties to Test:**
- **Accounting Equation:** Assets = Liabilities + Equity (always)
- **Debits = Credits:** Every transaction balances
- **Fund Balances:** Never negative (or handle overdrafts explicitly)
- **Immutability:** Ledger entries never change after creation

---

### Financial Transaction Testing Harness (Sprint 3-4)

**Problem:** Need to test complete transaction flows (payment → ledger entry → balance update → bank reconciliation)
**Solution:** Build a testing harness that simulates transaction lifecycles with assertions at each step
**Impact:** Validates end-to-end correctness of financial operations
**Effort:** Large (3-4 weeks)
**Dependencies:** Test data generators, property-based framework
**Status:** Not Started
**PRD:** `product/PRDs/transaction-testing-harness-prd.md` (to be created)

---

### Plaid Bank Reconciliation Test Suite (Sprint 8-10)

**Problem:** Bank sync is complex - webhooks, duplicate detection, transaction categorization, timezone handling
**Solution:** Mock Plaid API with realistic responses, test edge cases (duplicate transactions, missing data, late webhooks)
**Impact:** Prevents bank sync bugs that cause financial discrepancies
**Effort:** Large (4-5 weeks)
**Dependencies:** Transaction harness, test database
**Status:** Not Started
**PRD:** `product/PRDs/plaid-testing-prd.md` (to be created)

## Resource Allocation

### Team Capacity
- **Solo Founder:** Full-time on QA infrastructure
- **Running in parallel with:** saas202509 development

### Effort Distribution (Solo MVP)
- 50% - Test data generators & property-based testing (foundation)
- 30% - Integration testing & financial validators
- 15% - Documentation & test maintenance
- 5% - Experimentation (new testing techniques)

---

## Risks and Dependencies

| Risk/Dependency | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|-----------------|--------|------------|-------|
| **saas202509 architecture changes** | High - tests may break if accounting logic changes | Maintain close sync between projects, co-locate test code | Solo |
| **Complexity of property-based testing** | Medium - learning curve for Hypothesis/Fast-Check | Start simple, iterate, read docs thoroughly | Solo |
| **Test data doesn't match production complexity** | High - tests pass but prod fails | Consult HOA domain experts, use real anonymized data samples | Solo |
| **Test suite becomes too slow** | Medium - slows development velocity | Parallelize tests, use test database snapshots, optimize generators | Solo |

---

## What We're NOT Doing

Explicitly deprioritizing to stay focused on MVP:

- ❌ **UI/Frontend Testing** - Focus on backend financial logic first (Playwright/Cypress later)
- ❌ **Performance/Load Testing** - Correctness before speed (add in Q2 2026)
- ❌ **Security Testing** - Important but not blocking MVP (add penetration testing later)
- ❌ **Mutation Testing** - Advanced technique, nice-to-have (post-MVP)
- ❌ **Cross-Database Testing** - Assume PostgreSQL only for now (multi-DB support later)

---

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-10-27 | Start with test data generators + property-based testing | Foundation needed for all other testing; solo founder needs to see value fast |
| 2025-10-27 | Use schema-per-tenant test DB architecture | Must match saas202509 production architecture exactly |
| 2025-10-27 | Deprioritize UI testing in MVP | Backend financial correctness is higher risk; UI bugs are visible, financial bugs are catastrophic |

---

## Feedback and Questions

- **Question:** Should we build a testing UI/dashboard to visualize test results?
  - **Answer:** Later - focus on CLI-first testing for MVP, add dashboard in Q2 2026 if needed
