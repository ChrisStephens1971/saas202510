## How to Use

### Why Document Workflows?
As a solo founder, documenting processes helps you:
- Work more efficiently with repeatable processes
- Onboard contractors or future team members faster
- Reduce cognitive load ("What did I do last time?")
- Identify improvement opportunities
- Maintain consistency and quality

### When to Create a Workflow Document
Create a workflow when you:
- Do something for the second or third time
- Want to delegate or automate a task
- Need to ensure consistency (e.g., release process)
- Have a critical process that can't be forgotten

### Process Improvement
- Review workflows quarterly
- Update when processes change
- Note what works and what doesn't
- Simplify and automate where possible

## Examples

See `examples/` folder for sample workflows.

## Best Practices

- Keep workflows up to date
- Make them actionable (step-by-step)
- Include "why" not just "how"
- Add screenshots or diagrams where helpful
- Note failure modes and troubleshooting
- Review and improve regularly
