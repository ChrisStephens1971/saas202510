## Key Testing Patterns Implemented

### Financial Accuracy
- All monetary values use `Decimal` with exactly 2 decimal places
- Interest and inflation calculations preserve precision
- Transaction balancing with zero tolerance for errors

### Multi-Tenant Isolation
- Every test verifies tenant_id isolation
- Storage paths include tenant_id segregation
- Cross-tenant access prevention tests

### Workflow Validation
- Status transition testing for all workflows
- Escalation path verification
- Approval chain testing

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing data
- File size and type validation
- Duplicate prevention checks
