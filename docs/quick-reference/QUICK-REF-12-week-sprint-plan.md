## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Feature Creep
**Problem:** "Just one more feature..."
**Solution:** Write MVP scope, tape to wall, don't deviate

### 2. Perfectionism
**Problem:** Polishing endlessly, never shipping
**Solution:** "Good enough" for MVP, iterate based on feedback

### 3. Skipping Testing
**Problem:** Critical bugs in production
**Solution:** Friday testing ritual, minimum E2E tests

### 4. Ignoring Performance
**Problem:** Slow app kills activation
**Solution:** Week 8 dedicated to performance

### 5. No User Feedback
**Problem:** Building in vacuum
**Solution:** Show progress to potential customers weekly

---

## Adjustments for Your Situation

### If Learning Stack (+4 weeks = 16 total)
- Weeks 1-2: Learning & tutorials
- Weeks 3-18: Follow original plan (slower pace)
- Accept learning curve

### If Part-Time (20 hrs/week, 2x timeline = 24 weeks)
- Halve weekly deliverables
- Focus on consistency
- May need to reduce scope further

### If You Have Help (-2 to -4 weeks)
- Frontend dev: -2 weeks (parallel work)
- Full team (3-4): -4 weeks (6-8 weeks total)
- But add coordination overhead
