**Full version:** [saas-planning-example.md](saas-planning-example.md)

This is a condensed overview of the TeamFlow planning example. For complete details, see the full document.

## 1. Executive Summary (1 Page)

**Product:** TeamFlow - Project management for remote teams

**Core Problem:** Traditional PM tools focus on tasks, not asynchronous collaboration

**Differentiator:** AI-powered context synthesis eliminates status meetings

**Target Market:**
- Mid-market companies (100-2000 employees)
- Remote-first tech companies and digital agencies
- North America & Europe initially

**Expected Scale:**
- Year 1: 500 tenants (~25K users)
- Year 2: 2K tenants (~100K users)
- Year 3: 5K+ tenants (~250K+ users)

## 2. Technical Architecture (3 Pages)

**Multi-Tenancy:** Hybrid approach
- Starter/Pro: Shared database with RLS
- Enterprise: Dedicated database per tenant

**Stack:**
- Backend: Node.js + NestJS + GraphQL
- Frontend: React 18 + Next.js
- Database: PostgreSQL 15 (AWS RDS)
- Cache: Redis (ElastiCache)
- Infrastructure: AWS multi-region

**Security:**
- Auth: Email/password + 2FA, SSO (SAML/OIDC)
- Data: TLS 1.3, AES-256, AWS KMS
- API: Rate limiting, JWT tokens

**Key Trade-offs:**
- Hybrid tenancy adds complexity but enables enterprise sales
- GraphQL over REST for flexibility
- NestJS for structure vs. Express for simplicity

## 8. Key Decisions & Rationale

**Why Hybrid Multi-Tenancy?**
- Balance cost efficiency for SMB with isolation for Enterprise
- Enable multiple market segments
- Migration path from shared to dedicated

**Why Node.js/NestJS?**
- Team expertise in JavaScript
- Faster full-stack development
- Mature ecosystem
- NestJS provides structure at scale

**Why GraphQL?**
- Reduces over-fetching
- Better for mobile clients
- Strong typing
- Trade-off: Steeper learning curve

**Why No Mobile Apps in MVP?**
- Mobile-responsive web sufficient for validation
- Native apps are 2x development effort
- Can ship web first, native in Phase 2

**Why Start with Self-Service?**
- Faster revenue
- Lower CAC
- Prove product-market fit
- Build enterprise features later

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Database connection exhaustion | High | PgBouncer pooling, query optimization |
| AI cost overruns | Medium | Usage throttling, caching, rate limits |
| WebSocket scaling | Medium | Sticky sessions, Redis adapter, fallback to polling |
| Competition | High | Niche focus (remote teams), rapid iteration |
| Slow enterprise sales | Medium | Strong self-service foundation first |
