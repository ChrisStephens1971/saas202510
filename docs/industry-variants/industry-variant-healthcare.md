# Healthcare SaaS Planning - Industry-Specific Addendum

Use this addendum **in addition to** the main SaaS planning template (Lite or Full). Healthcare SaaS applications have unique regulatory, security, and operational requirements.

## When to Use This Addendum

Use this if your SaaS handles any of the following:
- Protected Health Information (PHI)
- Patient data or medical records
- Healthcare provider workflows
- Clinical decision support
- Health insurance or billing data
- Wellness or telehealth services touching medical data

**Note:** Even "wellness" apps may require HIPAA compliance if they share data with covered entities.

## Healthcare SaaS MVP Recommendations

### For Solo Healthcare Founders

**Start Small and Narrow:**
- Choose non-HIPAA wellness use case if possible (e.g., fitness, nutrition without PHI)
- If PHI is required, start with single specialty or workflow
- Prioritize one EHR integration maximum for MVP
- Defer FDA-regulated features until post-MVP

**But Don't Compromise On:**
- Security architecture (build it right from day one)
- Basic HIPAA compliance (if handling PHI)
- Encryption and access controls
- Audit logging
- BAAs with vendors

**Expect Different Timelines:**
- MVP: 6-12 months (vs. 8-12 weeks for non-healthcare)
- HITRUST certification: 12-18 months
- First healthcare customer: 6-12 month sales cycle
- FDA clearance (if needed): 12-24 months

**Budget Considerations:**
- HITRUST certification: $50K-$150K
- Healthcare compliance attorney: $10K-$50K
- Security audit/pen testing: $15K-$30K annually
- FDA consulting (if applicable): $50K-$200K
- Additional infrastructure costs for compliance: +30-50%

## Recommended Technology Choices for Healthcare

### Cloud Infrastructure
- **AWS:** HIPAA-eligible services with BAA (most mature)
- **Azure:** Strong healthcare ecosystem, HITRUST certified
- **Google Cloud:** HIPAA-compliant services available
- **Do NOT use:** Providers without BAA or HIPAA attestations

### Specific Services to Consider
- **Database:** AWS RDS with encryption, Azure SQL, or self-managed PostgreSQL with encryption
- **File Storage:** AWS S3 with encryption, Azure Blob Storage
- **Email:** Paubox, HealthMailbox (HIPAA-compliant email)
- **Analytics:** Avoid GA4, use self-hosted or healthcare-specific analytics
- **Monitoring:** DataDog (with BAA), Splunk (HIPAA-compliant)

### Services to AVOID
- ✗ Google Analytics (no BAA)
- ✗ Many popular analytics tools (no BAA)
- ✗ Consumer cloud storage (Dropbox personal, Google Drive personal)
- ✗ Standard email providers without healthcare focus
- ✗ Many chat/support tools without BAA

---

## Healthcare Customer Onboarding Differences

### Security Review Process
- Expect comprehensive security questionnaires (HIPAA-specific)
- Provide SOC 2 report and HITRUST certification
- Technical security review with CISO/security team
- Architecture review and data flow diagrams
- Vendor risk assessment process (2-6 months)

### Procurement Process
- Value Analysis Committee (VAC) presentation
- Clinical champions required
- Budget cycles (often annual, Q4 planning)
- Multiple stakeholders (clinical, IT, compliance, legal, finance)
- Pilot/trial before full deployment
- Executive approval for larger deals

### Implementation Timeline
- 3-6 months typical for enterprise healthcare
- Extensive training required
- Workflow integration critical
- Go-live support essential
- Phased rollout common

## When to Pivot Away from Healthcare

Healthcare SaaS is rewarding but challenging. Consider pivoting if:

- You cannot commit 6-12+ months to MVP
- Budget is <$100K (healthcare adds significant costs)
- You lack healthcare domain expertise or advisors
- Sales timeline doesn't align with runway
- Compliance complexity is overwhelming

**Alternative Paths:**
- Start with non-PHI wellness/fitness version
- Target administrative workflows (no clinical data)
- Build API/infrastructure for healthcare (B2B2C model)
- Partner with established healthcare company

---

## Healthcare Success Metrics

Beyond standard SaaS metrics, track:

**Clinical Metrics:**
- Clinical outcomes improvement
- Error reduction rates
- Time savings for clinicians
- Patient satisfaction scores
- Care quality measures

**Compliance Metrics:**
- Days since last security incident
- Audit finding closure rate
- Training completion rates
- Access request fulfillment time
- Breach notification time (if applicable)

**Adoption Metrics:**
- Provider adoption rate
- Clinical workflow integration success
- EHR integration uptime
- Patient engagement rates

## Final Healthcare Founder Advice

Healthcare is one of the most rewarding but challenging SaaS markets:

**Pros:**
- High willingness to pay for value
- Long customer lifetimes
- Meaningful impact on patient care
- Defensible moats via compliance and integration

**Cons:**
- Complex regulatory environment
- Long sales cycles (6-18 months)
- High compliance and operational costs
- Challenging interoperability landscape
- Risk of patient harm requires vigilance

**Bottom line for solo founders:** Healthcare SaaS is possible but requires domain expertise, significant capital, and patience. If you have healthcare background and are deeply passionate about the problem, proceed with eyes wide open. Otherwise, consider starting with a non-PHI use case to learn the market.

Success in healthcare SaaS requires:
✓ Domain expertise or strong clinical advisors
✓ Compliance-first mindset from day one
✓ Minimum 18-24 month runway
✓ Patient capital (longer to revenue)
✓ Deep commitment to clinical safety

If you have these, healthcare SaaS can be incredibly rewarding. If not, consider alternative paths into healthcare innovation.
