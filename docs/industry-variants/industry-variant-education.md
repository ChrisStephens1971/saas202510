## Final EdTech Founder Advice

EdTech is one of the most mission-driven but operationally challenging SaaS markets:

**Pros:**
- Meaningful social impact
- Large addressable market
- Recurring revenue potential
- Network effects within schools/districts
- Multiple revenue models possible (B2B, B2C, grants)

**Cons:**
- Long sales cycles (3-18 months for institutions)
- Complex privacy and accessibility requirements
- Low willingness to pay (especially K-12)
- Challenging ROI demonstrations
- Seasonal usage patterns (academic calendar)
- Resistance to change in education

**Bottom line for solo founders:** EdTech is possible solo with right approach:
- **Do:** Start direct-to-teacher or direct-to-consumer
- **Do:** Build privacy and accessibility from day one
- **Do:** Engage educators early and often (as advisors, pilots, champions)
- **Do:** Create freemium offering to build user base
- **Don't:** Try to sell to districts until you have strong product-market fit
- **Don't:** Ignore privacy or accessibility (non-negotiable)

Success in EdTech requires:
✓ Genuine understanding of education challenges
✓ Educator advisors and champions
✓ Privacy-first mindset
✓ Accessibility commitment
✓ Patient capital (education moves slowly)
✓ Passion for learning and social impact

**Recommended Solo Founder Entry Points:**
1. **Best:** Direct-to-consumer (parents, adult learners)
2. **Good:** Freemium for teachers with viral growth potential
3. **Possible:** Niche subject area or skill with passionate community
4. **Avoid (initially):** District B2B sales, complex LMS/SIS integrations

Start with a specific learner pain point, build a solution teachers and students love, then expand to institutional sales once you have traction and testimonials.

**Remember:** In EdTech, teachers and students are your users, but often not your buyers (in K-12). Build for users first, buyers second. A product teachers and students love will eventually find its way into schools, but a product optimized for procurement without user love will fail.

Good luck building something that helps people learn! 🎓
