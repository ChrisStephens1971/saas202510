## Fintech MVP Recommendations

### For Solo Fintech Founders

**Start with Partnerships, Not Licenses:**
- Use Stripe for payments (avoids MTL complexity)
- Use Plaid for bank connections (read-only, minimal regulation)
- Partner with licensed entities rather than getting own licenses
- Focus on software layer, not money movement infrastructure

**Recommended MVP Approaches:**

**1. Financial Data/Analytics SaaS (Lowest Regulatory Burden):**
- Aggregate financial data via Plaid
- Provide insights, reporting, forecasting
- No money movement = minimal licensing
- Still need strong data security

**2. Payment Facilitation (Medium Regulatory Burden):**
- Use Stripe Connect or similar
- Payment processor handles compliance
- Focus on vertical-specific UX
- Still need AML/KYC for risk management

**3. Embedded Finance (Use BaaS Provider):**
- Partner with Unit, Synapse, or Treasury Prime
- BaaS provider holds licenses and handles compliance
- You build application layer
- Faster to market but revenue share with partner

**Avoid for Solo MVP:**
- ✗ Obtaining your own money transmitter licenses (too slow, expensive)
- ✗ Direct bank integrations without processor
- ✗ Holding customer funds without bank partner
- ✗ Lending without lending license or partner
- ✗ Securities products without broker-dealer license

**Timeline Expectations:**
- Financial data SaaS: 3-6 months to MVP
- Payment facilitation: 4-8 months to MVP
- Embedded finance: 6-12 months to MVP
- Licensed money transmitter: 18-36 months (don't do solo)

**Budget Considerations (Beyond Standard SaaS):**
- Fintech attorney: $20K-$100K annually
- Compliance consultant: $10K-$50K annually
- SOC 2 audit: $15K-$40K
- PCI DSS audit (if needed): $20K-$50K
- Partner revenue share: 20-50% of transaction revenue

## Fintech Customer Onboarding Differences

### Identity Verification Flow

### Onboarding Friction Trade-offs
- **Frictionless:** Higher fraud, higher abandonment risk, regulatory risk
- **Balanced:** Document + selfie, auto-decisioning, reasonable security
- **High Friction:** Multiple documents, manual review, high security
- Choose based on: Product risk level, target customer, regulatory requirements

### Ongoing Monitoring
- Periodic re-verification (annually or when suspicious activity)

- Adverse media and watchlist monitoring
- Beneficial ownership updates for businesses

- Risk tolerance too low for financial liability

**Alternative Paths:**
- Build for fintech companies (B2B tooling)
- Focus on financial data/insights without money movement
- Start with Stripe-powered simple payments, expand later
- Join established fintech to learn, then start your own

## Final Fintech Founder Advice

Fintech is one of the highest-opportunity but highest-complexity SaaS markets:

**Pros:**
- Large addressable markets
- High transaction volumes = high revenue potential
- Sticky products (switching costs are high)
- Network effects in payments
- Premium valuations

**Cons:**
- Complex regulatory environment
- High compliance and operational costs (20-30% overhead)
- Long time to market with licensing (18-24 months)
- Need for significant capital reserves
- Fraud and financial crime risk
- Bank partner dependency

**Bottom line for solo founders:** Fintech is challenging solo but possible with right approach:
- **Do:** Partner with licensed entities, focus on software layer
- **Do:** Start with low-regulation use case (data, analytics)
- **Do:** Build security and compliance from day one
- **Don't:** Try to obtain your own licenses as solo founder
- **Don't:** Underestimate compliance burden and costs

Success in fintech requires:
✓ Domain expertise or strong fintech advisors
✓ Compliance-first mindset
✓ Significant capital (18-24 month runway minimum)
✓ Risk management capabilities
✓ Strong banking relationships

If you have these or can build them quickly, fintech can be extremely rewarding. The key is finding the right entry point that balances regulatory burden with market opportunity.

**Recommended Solo Founder Entry Points:**
1. **Best:** Build on Stripe/Plaid (minimal regulation, fast to market)
2. **Good:** Partner with BaaS provider for embedded finance
3. **Possible:** Vertical-specific fintech with existing compliance partners
4. **Avoid:** Getting your own licenses or direct money movement

Start small, prove the model, then expand into more complex financial services as you grow and raise capital.
