Unlike traditional project management tools that focus on task tracking, TeamFlow emphasizes asynchronous collaboration, timezone-aware workflows, and context preservation to reduce meeting overhead and improve remote team productivity.

**Core Differentiator:** AI-powered context synthesis that automatically generates project status updates by analyzing work patterns, eliminating the need for daily standups and status meetings.

### Target Market and Scale

**Primary Target:**
- Mid-market companies (100-2000 employees) with distributed teams
- Technology companies, digital agencies, and remote-first organizations
- Initial focus: North America and Europe, with expansion to APAC in Year 2

**Expected Scale:**
- Year 1: 500 paying tenants (~25,000 users)
- Year 2: 2,000 tenants (~100,000 users)
- Year 3: 5,000+ tenants (~250,000+ users)

### Key Differentiators

1. **Async-First Design:** Built for asynchronous work patterns with threaded discussions, video updates, and automatic context capture
2. **AI Context Synthesis:** Automatically generates human-readable status updates from work activity
3. **Timezone Intelligence:** Smart scheduling and notification delivery based on team member locations
4. **Integration Hub:** Deep integrations with GitHub, Figma, Slack, and 50+ other tools
5. **Privacy-First:** SOC 2 Type II compliance from launch, GDPR-ready architecture

## 2. Technical Architecture Plan

### Multi-Tenancy Architecture Decision

**Selected Approach:** Hybrid multi-tenancy model

**Rationale:**
- **Starter/Professional Tiers:** Shared database with shared schema (AWS RDS PostgreSQL with row-level security)
  - Cost-effective for smaller tenants
  - Uses PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for tenant isolation
  - Tenant ID as discriminator column on all tables

- **Enterprise Tier:** Separate database per tenant
  - Dedicated RDS instance per enterprise customer
  - Full data isolation for compliance and security requirements
  - Custom backup schedules and retention policies
  - Ability to support on-premises deployments in future

**Migration Path:** Automated migration tool to move tenants from shared to dedicated databases as they upgrade to Enterprise.

### Technology Stack and Infrastructure

**Backend:**
- **Framework:** Node.js with NestJS (TypeScript)
- **API:** GraphQL for primary API, REST for webhooks and integrations
- **Real-time:** WebSocket connections via Socket.io for live updates
- **Background Jobs:** BullMQ with Redis for job queuing
- **Search:** Elasticsearch for full-text search across projects and tasks

**Frontend:**
- **Framework:** React 18 with Next.js for SSR
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit + RTK Query
- **UI Components:** Custom design system built on Radix UI
- **Mobile:** React Native (Phase 2)

**Databases:**
- **Primary:** PostgreSQL 15 (AWS RDS)
- **Cache:** Redis (AWS ElastiCache)
- **Search:** Elasticsearch (AWS OpenSearch)
- **File Storage:** AWS S3 with CloudFront CDN

**Infrastructure:**
- **Cloud Provider:** AWS (Multi-region: us-east-1 primary, eu-west-1 secondary)
- **Container Orchestration:** AWS ECS with Fargate
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform
- **Monitoring:** DataDog for APM, AWS CloudWatch for infrastructure

### Security Architecture

**Authentication:**
- Email/password with mandatory 2FA for team admins
- SSO via SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect (Google, Microsoft, Okta)
- Magic link authentication option
- Session management with short-lived JWT + refresh tokens

**Authorization:**
- Custom RBAC system with hierarchical roles
- Tenant-level roles: Owner, Admin, Member, Guest
- Project-level roles: Project Lead, Contributor, Observer
- Fine-grained permissions system for features

**Data Protection:**
- TLS 1.3 for all data in transit
- AES-256 encryption for data at rest
- Database-level encryption via AWS KMS
- Envelope encryption for sensitive data (API keys, SSO configs)
- Secrets management via AWS Secrets Manager

**API Security:**
- Rate limiting: 1000 req/hour per user, 10,000 req/hour per tenant
- API key authentication for integrations
- Webhook signature verification (HMAC-SHA256)
- GraphQL query complexity limiting
- CORS policies configured per tenant domain

### Scalability Approach

**Horizontal Scaling:**
- Stateless application servers in auto-scaling groups
- Target: 60% CPU utilization triggers scale-up
- Minimum 3 instances per region for redundancy
- Database read replicas for query load distribution

**Geographic Distribution:**
- Multi-region active-passive setup initially
- CloudFront CDN for static assets and file downloads
- S3 cross-region replication for user uploads
- Elasticsearch cluster per region

**Background Processing:**
- Separate worker pools for different job types (AI processing, notifications, exports)
- Horizontal scaling based on queue depth
- Priority queues for time-sensitive operations

**Real-Time Features:**
- WebSocket connection pooling across multiple servers
- Redis Pub/Sub for cross-server message broadcasting
- Presence tracking with Redis sorted sets
- Graceful degradation to polling if WebSocket unavailable

### Key Technical Trade-Offs and Risks

**Trade-Offs:**
1. **Hybrid Multi-Tenancy:** Added complexity in managing two isolation models, but enables better enterprise sales
2. **GraphQL:** Steeper learning curve for API consumers, but provides better flexibility and reduces over-fetching
3. **NestJS:** Less common than Express, but provides better structure and maintainability at scale

**Technical Risks:**
1. **Database Connection Pool Exhaustion:** Mitigated by connection pooling with PgBouncer and strict query optimization
2. **AI Cost Overruns:** Implemented usage-based throttling and caching of AI-generated content
3. **WebSocket Scaling:** Use sticky sessions and Redis adapter, with fallback to HTTP long-polling
4. **Multi-Region Latency:** Accept eventual consistency for non-critical data, use read replicas strategically

### API Versioning and Backwards Compatibility

**API Versioning Strategy:**
- URI versioning: `/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/`
- Current version: v1
- Minimum support: 2 major versions

**Deprecation Policy:**
- 12-month notice for breaking changes
- 6-month parallel support for old and new versions
- Email notifications at 12, 6, 3, and 1 month before deprecation
- Automatic migration tooling where possible

**Compatibility Promise:**
- Additive changes (new fields, endpoints) don't require version bump
- Behavioral changes require new version
- Security fixes may require breaking changes with shorter notice
