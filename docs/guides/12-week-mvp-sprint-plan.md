# 12-Week MVP Sprint Plan
## Based on TeamFlow Example (Adapted for Solo Founder)

This is a realistic 12-week sprint plan for building a multi-tenant SaaS MVP as a solo founder. Based on the TeamFlow example but adapted for one person working full-time.

**Important Notes for Solo Founders:**
- This assumes 40-50 hour weeks (sustainable pace)
- Features are aggressively scoped down to MVP essentials
- Weeks 1-8 focus on core product, Weeks 9-12 on polish and launch prep
- Adjust timeline based on your expertise (faster if expert, slower if learning)

## Scope Management (What's NOT in 12 Weeks)

To keep this realistic, these are explicitly **NOT included** in the 12-week MVP:

**Defer to Post-MVP:**
- ❌ AI status updates (Phase 2 feature)
- ❌ Advanced integrations (Slack, GitHub, etc.) - save for Weeks 13+
- ❌ Mobile native apps
- ❌ SSO/SAML (add for enterprise later)
- ❌ Advanced reporting and analytics
- ❌ Custom fields and workflows
- ❌ Time tracking
- ❌ File attachments (add in Week 13-14)
- ❌ Video messages
- ❌ Advanced admin features
- ❌ API for third-parties
- ❌ Webhooks
- ❌ SOC 2 compliance (start process after traction)

**Keep MVP Focused:**
The goal is to launch something users can use to manage projects and tasks as a distributed team. Everything else can wait.

---

## Weekly Rhythm & Best Practices

### Monday Morning (2 hours)
- Review previous week's accomplishments
- Plan current week's tasks
- Adjust timeline if needed
- Update project board (Trello, Linear, etc.)

### Tuesday-Thursday (Deep Work)
- Focus blocks: 2-4 hour uninterrupted coding
- Pomodoro technique if helpful
- Avoid meetings and distractions
- Ship features progressively (don't wait till Friday)

### Friday (4-6 hours)
- Testing and QA
- Deploy to staging
- Documentation
- Retrospective (what went well, what to improve)
- Update stakeholders/advisors if applicable

### Sustainability Tips
- **Don't burn out:** 50 hours/week max
- **Take weekends off:** You need rest to be productive
- **Ship continuously:** Deploy to staging daily if possible
- **Cut scope, not quality:** Better to ship fewer features well than many badly
- **Ask for help:** Use communities (Discord, Reddit, Twitter) when stuck

---

## Risk Management

### Common Risks & Mitigations

**Risk: Falling behind schedule**
- **Mitigation:** Cut scope, not quality. Remove nice-to-haves from MVP
- **Action:** Weekly scope review, be ruthless about what's essential

**Risk: Technical blockers (stuck on hard problem)**
- **Mitigation:** Time-box problem solving (4 hours max), then seek help
- **Action:** Join communities, hire consultant for specific problem, use ChatGPT/Claude

**Risk: Scope creep (adding features)**
- **Mitigation:** Strict "no new features" rule until Week 13
- **Action:** Keep backlog, but don't implement until post-launch

**Risk: Burnout**
- **Mitigation:** Sustainable pace, weekends off, exercise, sleep
- **Action:** If burning out, extend timeline rather than crash

**Risk: Low code quality (tech debt)**
- **Mitigation:** Write tests for critical paths, refactor as you go
- **Action:** Friday is for cleanup and refactoring

---

## Adjustments for Different Scenarios

### If You're Learning Stack (+4 weeks)
- Add 4 weeks to timeline (16 weeks total)
- Weeks 1-2: Learning and tutorials
- Accept slower progress initially
- Consider using more managed services (Supabase, Firebase)

### If You Have Front-End Help (-2 weeks)
- Designer/front-end dev can work in parallel
- You focus on backend/infrastructure
- Shave 2 weeks off timeline (10 weeks)

### If You're Part-Time (20 hrs/week, 2x timeline)
- Double all estimates: 24 weeks
- Focus on consistency over intensity
- May need to further reduce scope

### If You're More Than Solo (Small Team)
- 2 people: Reduce to 8-10 weeks
- 3-4 people: Reduce to 6-8 weeks
- But add coordination overhead
- Use this plan as baseline, adjust

---

## Definition of Done (MVP Launch)

You're ready to launch when:
- [ ] Core workflows functional (signup → create project → add tasks → collaborate)
- [ ] No critical bugs
- [ ] Basic security and privacy in place
- [ ] Payments working (can charge customers)
- [ ] Monitoring and error tracking active
- [ ] Help docs for key features
- [ ] Terms and Privacy live
- [ ] Can support 50-100 users without major issues
- [ ] You would use it yourself for real work

**You don't need perfect. Ship when it's good enough.**

---

## Success Metrics (First 90 Days Post-Launch)

Track these metrics:
- **Signups:** 100+ in first 30 days (goal)
- **Activation:** 30%+ create first project and add 3+ tasks

### Code & Deployment
- **GitHub:** Version control
- **Vercel, Railway, or Fly.io:** Easy deployment for MVP
- **Heroku:** Simple but more expensive

### Monitoring & Error Tracking
- **Sentry:** Error tracking (free tier)
- **LogRocket:** Session replay (helpful for bugs)
- **DataDog or CloudWatch:** Infrastructure monitoring

### Analytics
- **Mixpanel or Amplitude:** Product analytics (free tier)
- **Google Analytics 4:** Basic traffic analytics
- **PostHog:** Open-source alternative (self-hosted or cloud)

### Communication
- **Slack or Discord:** Community (if building one)
- **Intercom or plain email:** Customer support

## Final Thoughts for Solo Founders

**12 weeks is aggressive but doable if:**
- ✅ You're an experienced full-stack developer
- ✅ You're using familiar technologies
- ✅ You're working full-time on this
- ✅ You're disciplined about scope
- ✅ You have some design skills or templates

**Be honest with yourself:**
- If learning new stack, add time
- If part-time, double timeline
- If this is your first SaaS, add buffer
- If perfectionist, fight that urge

**Most important:**
- Ship something, even if imperfect
- Get real user feedback ASAP
- Iterate based on actual usage
- Don't build in a vacuum for 6 months

**You've got this! 🚀**
