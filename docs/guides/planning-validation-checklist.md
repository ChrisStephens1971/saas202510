## Solo Founder Specific Considerations

If you're a solo founder, use these adjusted thresholds:

### MVP Readiness (Solo Founder)

**Critical for Solo MVP (Must be 100%):**
- [ ] Product vision clear
- [ ] Tech stack selected (familiar to you)
- [ ] Multi-tenancy approach decided
- [ ] Security basics planned
- [ ] Pricing model defined
- [ ] First 10 customers identified
- [ ] 6-month budget allocated

**Can Be "Good Enough" for Solo MVP (70-80% okay):**
- Product roadmap beyond MVP
- Advanced scalability planning
- Formal compliance certifications (unless regulated industry)
- Sophisticated analytics
- Detailed risk management

**Can Defer Until Traction (Don't block MVP):**
- SOC 2 audit (unless enterprise customers day 1)
- Advanced integrations
- Team hiring plans
- Formal sales process
- Complex tenant customization

### Solo Founder Red Flags

Stop and reconsider if:
- ❌ You scored <50% on Technical Architecture
- ❌ Missing clarity on problem/customer
- ❌ No idea who first 10 customers are
- ❌ Tech stack unfamiliar (learning curve too high)
- ❌ Regulated industry without domain expertise
- ❌ <3 months runway remaining
