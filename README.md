# QA/Testing Infrastructure for Multi-Tenant HOA Accounting System

**Project ID:** saas202510
**Related System:** [saas202509 - Multi-Tenant HOA Accounting System](C:/devop/saas202509)
**Purpose:** Zero-tolerance quality assurance and testing infrastructure for financial accounting software

This project ensures 100% accuracy in the accounting system through comprehensive testing:
- **Property-based testing** for financial invariants (debits = credits, balances never negative)
- **Integration tests** for all accounting workflows (payments, refunds, bank reconciliation)
- **Data type validation** (NUMERIC(15,2) for money, DATE for dates - no floats!)
- **Compliance verification** (immutable audit trails, point-in-time reconstruction)

## 🎯 Test Coverage

**Current Status:** ✅ 97 tests passing (100% success rate)

| Sprint | Feature Area | Tests | Status |
|--------|-------------|-------|--------|
| Sprint 10 | Budget Management | 35 tests | ✅ Passing |
| Sprint 11 | Dashboard Metrics | 22 tests | ✅ Passing |
| Sprint 12 | Bank Reconciliation | 18 tests | ✅ Passing |
| Sprint 13 | Funds Management | 22 tests | ✅ Passing |

**Test Execution Time:** ~7-8 seconds for full suite

## 🔄 Continuous Integration

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Documentation

**✅ Do:**
- Update docs as you go (not after)
- Document "why" not just "what"
- Link related documents
- Use examples to clarify
- Keep it scannable (headings, bullets, tables)

**❌ Don't:**
- Over-document (80% done > perfect)
- Let docs go stale
- Write docs no one reads
- Copy-paste without customizing

### Planning

**✅ Do:**
- Start simple, add complexity as needed
- Review retrospectives and adjust
- Be honest about timelines
- Celebrate wins
- Keep the customer at the center

**❌ Don't:**
- Overthink (paralysis by analysis)
- Ignore retrospective insights
- Commit to unrealistic deadlines
- Plan in isolation

### Process

**✅ Do:**
- Document processes you repeat
- Automate where possible
- Review quarterly
- Make it easy to follow

**❌ Don't:**
- Create unnecessary bureaucracy
- Make processes too rigid
- Skip retrospectives
- Ignore pain points
