## 🎯 Best Practices

### Documentation

**✅ Do:**
- Update docs as you go (not after)
- Document "why" not just "what"
- Link related documents
- Use examples to clarify
- Keep it scannable (headings, bullets, tables)

**❌ Don't:**
- Over-document (80% done > perfect)
- Let docs go stale
- Write docs no one reads
- Copy-paste without customizing

### Planning

**✅ Do:**
- Start simple, add complexity as needed
- Review retrospectives and adjust
- Be honest about timelines
- Celebrate wins
- Keep the customer at the center

**❌ Don't:**
- Overthink (paralysis by analysis)
- Ignore retrospective insights
- Commit to unrealistic deadlines
- Plan in isolation

### Process

**✅ Do:**
- Document processes you repeat
- Automate where possible
- Review quarterly
- Make it easy to follow

**❌ Don't:**
- Create unnecessary bureaucracy
- Make processes too rigid
- Skip retrospectives
- Ignore pain points
