## Test Strategy

### Test Pyramid Approach

**Unit Tests (70%)** - Component-level testing
- **Target Coverage:** >80% of code
- **Tools:** Jest, Pytest, JUnit, Vitest
- **What to test:** Individual functions, classes, components
- **Responsibility:** Developers write alongside code

**Integration Tests (20%)** - Service/API testing
- **Target Coverage:** All critical API endpoints
- **Tools:** Supertest, Postman, REST Assured
- **What to test:** API contracts, service interactions, database operations
- **Responsibility:** Developers + QA

**End-to-End Tests (10%)** - User workflow testing
- **Target Coverage:** Happy paths + critical user journeys
- **Tools:** Playwright, Cypress, Selenium
- **What to test:** Complete user workflows, UI interactions
- **Responsibility:** QA team

### Test Environments

| Environment | Purpose | Data | Access |
|-------------|---------|------|--------|
| Local | Development testing | Mock/fake data | Developers |
| Staging | Pre-production testing | Sanitized prod data | QA team |
| Production-like | Performance/load testing | Realistic data | DevOps/QA |

### Test Data Strategy

**Test Data Sources:**
- [ ] Seeded test data (for consistent tests)
- [ ] Generated fake data (for volume testing)
- [ ] Anonymized production data (for realistic scenarios)

**Data Management:**
- **Creation:** [How test data is created]
- **Cleanup:** [How test data is cleaned up after tests]
- **Sensitive Data:** [How PII/sensitive data is handled]

## Test Cases

### Critical Path Tests
> These are the most important user workflows that MUST work

|----|----------|----------|------|-------|--------|
| TC-001 | [User can log in] | Critical | E2E | [Name] | [ ] |
| TC-002 | [User can create item] | Critical | Integration | [Name] | [ ] |
| TC-003 | [Data saves correctly] | Critical | Integration | [Name] | [ ] |

### Happy Path Tests
> Standard user workflows under normal conditions

| ID | Scenario | Type | Status |
|----|----------|------|--------|
| TC-101 | [Standard workflow 1] | E2E | [ ] |
| TC-102 | [Standard workflow 2] | E2E | [ ] |

### Edge Cases and Error Handling
> Unusual inputs, boundary conditions, error scenarios

| ID | Scenario | Type | Expected Result | Status |
|----|----------|------|-----------------|--------|
| EC-001 | Invalid email format | Unit | Show error message | [ ] |
| EC-002 | Empty required field | Integration | Validation error | [ ] |
| EC-003 | Concurrent edits | Integration | Conflict resolution | [ ] |

### Performance Tests

**Load Testing:**
- [ ] 100 concurrent users
- [ ] 1,000 concurrent users
- [ ] Peak load (expected maximum)

**Performance Benchmarks:**
| Metric | Target | Threshold |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| API response time (p95) | <200ms | <500ms |
| Page load time | <2s | <3s |
| Database query time | <100ms | <300ms |
| Time to first byte (TTFB) | <600ms | <1000ms |

**Stress Testing:**
- [ ] Gradual load increase to find breaking point
- [ ] Recovery testing after overload
- [ ] Resource usage monitoring (CPU, memory)

### Security Tests

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- [ ] Login with valid credentials
- [ ] Login with invalid credentials
- [ ] Session timeout handling
- [ ] Password reset flow
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Unauthorized access attempts

**Input Validation:**
- [ ] SQL injection attempts
- [ ] XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attempts
- [ ] CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection
- [ ] File upload validation
- [ ] API input sanitization

**Data Protection:**
- [ ] Sensitive data encryption at rest
- [ ] Sensitive data encryption in transit (HTTPS)
- [ ] PII handling compliance
- [ ] API key security

### Accessibility Tests

- [ ] Keyboard navigation
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Color contrast requirements (WCAG AA)
- [ ] Focus indicators visible
- [ ] Alternative text for images

## Bug Tracking

### Severity Levels
- **Critical:** System down, data loss, security breach
- **High:** Major feature broken, no workaround
- **Medium:** Feature partially broken, workaround exists
- **Low:** Minor issue, cosmetic, enhancement

### Priority Levels
- **P0 (Blocker):** Blocks release, must fix immediately
- **P1 (High):** Should fix before release
- **P2 (Medium):** Fix in next release
- **P3 (Low):** Nice to have, backlog

### Bug Workflow
```
New → Triaged → In Progress → Code Review → Testing → Verified → Closed
                                                    ↓
                                               Reopened (if fails)
```

### Bug Report Template Location

## Test Automation Strategy

### What to Automate
✅ **Automate:**
- Regression tests
- Repetitive manual tests
- API/integration tests
- Performance tests
- Security scans
- Data validation
- Cross-browser testing

❌ **Don't Automate (Manual Testing):**
- Exploratory testing
- Usability testing
- Visual design review
- Complex user workflows (first time)
- Ad-hoc testing

### CI/CD Integration

**Test Execution Schedule:**
- **On every commit:** Unit tests, linting
- **On pull request:** Unit + integration tests
- **On merge to main:** Full test suite
- **Nightly:** E2E tests, performance tests, security scans
- **Weekly:** Full regression suite

**Quality Gates:**
- [ ] All tests must pass to merge PR
- [ ] Code coverage must not decrease
- [ ] No critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

**Tools:**
- CI/CD Platform: GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / CircleCI
- Test Reporting: Allure, ReportPortal
- Code Coverage: Codecov, SonarQube
